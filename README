==================================================
 Ghetto-style Geo App for Can’t-Hack-It Djangoers
==================================================

I don’t want to bother with setting up everything involved with running
Geo-Django, but I do want to track data about locations and tie locations to
other objects. This app is my sort-of-thought-out answer.

Django_ 1.0 or later is required.

TODO
----

1. Write tests.
2. Write Spanish translation (just for fun).
